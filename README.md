The task involved creating a classic Snake game in Java, where a snake moves around a game board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries.
Steps Taken :
1. Created a Java project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Defined the game board using a 2D array to represent the grid.
3. Implemented the `Snake` class with properties for length, direction, and body segments. Also included methods for moving the snake, checking collisions, and growing the snake.
4. Created the `Food` class to represent food items appearing at random positions on the game board.
5. Implemented the main game loop to control the game flow, handle user input, and update snake and food positions.
6. Allowed user input to control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
7. Utilized Java Swing for the graphical interface, displaying the game board, snake, food, and score.
8. Handled collisions between the snake, food, and game boundaries, ending the game when necessary.
9. Added scoring based on the length of the snake and the number of food items eaten.
10. Implemented a game over message and provided an option to restart the game.
